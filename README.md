# Password-Generator
Hello! 

This first-month project is a Random Password Generator, with options to use upper- and lower-cased characters, numbers and or symbols.  If no options are selected, then a password will not appear.  Otherwise, a random password between 8 & 128 characters will be produced depending on what kinds of characters the user confirms. 

The design is simple, most of the time involved in building this before deadline went to working out the various array options.
